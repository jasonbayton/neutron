# What is MDM?

MDM stands for Mobile Device Management and is one of the core new services residing around the management of mobile devices. 
MDM allows for over-the-air set up and configuration of devices, enforced security, simple access to corporate resources (such as email), removal/limitation of features and the ability to find lost or stolen devices at a moment's notice. More than this, it helps the industry to help the end user. Tasks such as resetting the PIN or password, blocking the use of dangerous applications and remotely wiping a device (should it be necessary) are available at the push of a button, meaning resolutions to issues historically complex and time consuming can be almost immediate.

But it doesn't stop there; we can also securely push out documents, applications and monitor data usage using Mobile Application Management, Mobile File Management and Mobile Expense Management services respectively in the broader EMM scope.

Having the ability to roll out an application to a vast number of devices simultaneously has huge benefits, not least in the time it saves having end-users locate and install applications themselves. Despite it having its own acronym – MAM – this is available almost as standard in MDM platforms and provides a secure location for all public and in-house applications, meaning access can be granted and removed from confidential information quickly and efficiently, leaving little doubt of confidential data being stored on device storage. In combination with MDM, applications can be pushed out as part of the enrolment process, vastly improving deployment time for new devices and greatly improving the time it takes to reconfigure devices already in the wild.

Robust reporting modules built in to today’s MDM platforms mean we can generate various ad-hoc reports for installed software, storage usage, hardware, operating system information and more. This means we know exactly how a device is being used when issues arise and use this information when working towards a resolution. Naturally this information can be made available on request to those with the authorisation to do so.

#How can it help?

The MDM solution is a platform used to provide support to mobile devices anywhere in the world with an internet connection and offers the following benefits:

##Remote Management

As soon as a device is enrolled it becomes secure, prompting the user to set up a PIN or password depending on the policy immediately applied to their device. Devices do not have to be returned to base for new applications or settings to be applied and similarly, if an end user does not for any reason comply with the changes pushed out or the device is lost/stolen, there are a number of ways to utilise the inbuilt security features of an MDM solution to rectify the situation:

**PIN reset:** Occasionally a user may forget their PIN or password. Through MDM it is very easy to reset the PIN and have the user back up and running on their device in a fraction of the time of alternative methods. In a lot of situations, a user might end up completely resetting their device to factory settings either through too many wrong PIN combinations or intentionally to regain access to the device, causing significant impact on daily responsibilities whilst the device is set back up. With MDM, this is no longer a worry.

**Alerts:** If an end user becomes non-compliant with policies and compliance rules in place, alerts can be triggered to inform those requested of the action that triggered the non-compliant state.

**Enterprise wipe:** A partial wipe consists of removing all corporate data on a device put there by the MDM solution. This will include documents and applications accessed through the native mobile MDM application as well as corporate email. This will not wipe internal storage or external SD cards, nor will it remove personal information such as Google accounts or installed applications. The device will become unmanaged following an Enterprise wipe and will need to be re-enrolled in order to once again access corporate resources.

**Full wipe:** A full wipe will return a device to factory settings. All information will be removed. This includes MDM control, leaving the device completely unmanaged.

**Device block:** Partially or fully wiping a device is inefficient. It requires re-provisioning a device resulting in wasted time. Ideally it should be a last resort. For devices that need to be locked down for any reason, an alternative is to block the device. This prevents access to corporate resources (email, documents and applications) requiring a call to have it unblocked. At this point, the non-compliance issue can be discussed and potentially resolved over the telephone.

**Device lock:** Prevent access to a device by resetting the PIN/password to something only known by MDM administrators.

**Compliance:** In addition to setting rules on applications permitted, type of password in use, etc, it is possible to monitor the devices to ascertain whether or not end users are adhering to the rules in place. If for whatever reason they are not, it is possible to set a timer on their non-compliant state which can trigger any of the above actions after as little as 60 seconds or as long as several days. The end user will be fully aware they are non-compliant from the moment the native MDM application alerts them and will be told how long they have to rectify the situation. It is then in their best interest to become compliant in order to prevent the actions above taking place.

**Location information:** If a device is lost or stolen, MDM can assist in retrieving location information for the device providing it is switched on and connected to the internet.

##Application and document management

Application and document management allows for the distribution of applications and documents to as little as one and as many as all devices within a group quickly and easily. All applications and documents are located securely and are easily accessible from within the native MDM application(s) on the device. 

Most MDM solutions support the distribution of both Play Store/App Store apps and Enterprise apps not located within the Play Store/App Store catalogues.

Documents can be password protected and distributed or removed on request.

##Expense management (Addon)

Expense management allows for the monitoring of data usage for devices enrolled onto the MDM solution. Using a pre-configured data cap for a device, it is possible to monitor data usage against the limit and receive notifications when data usage surpasses set limits. 

For example: If members of a team have a set limit of 1GB of data per month, it will be possible to monitor the data usage on a daily basis and when reaching set limits such as 50%, 75% and/or 90%, an email can be scheduled to warn relevant people of the impending data limit in order to either prepare for or avoid costly over-usage.  

With this data you gain far more transparency over data usage within your team that can help to avoid surprise bills.
 
##App black and white lists

There are typically a number of applications that should not be used in the workplace. Using application blacklists it is possible to block the use of applications with minimal effort. 

This has two benefits:

* Blocking applications that are not permitted means focus fully remains on the permitted applications and tasks at hand.
* Application installation does not have to be prevented, allowing the installation of applications which are not blocked freely and in turn preventing wasted time logging requests for applications to be pushed out to a device.

On the other hand, using application whitelists take the polar opposite approach. Only applications permitted by management are permitted to be installed on a device. No other applications can be used unless they are first whitelisted. This allows a device to be used only for purpose with no wiggle room.

##Dashboard monitoring

Most MDM platforms are equipped with information-rich dashboards, customisable to accommodate any information deemed important. Monitoring this is a proactive approach to device management; a number of monitors can be put in place to provide real-time views over a client activities and compliance states, for example:

* If someone installs Angry Birds
* If a device OS version updates
* If the MDM application is removed from a device
* If a user is exceeding a set percentage of their mobile data limit

The list is not exhaustive and this can be set up to client requirements. Should one of the above become true, the requested contact will be informed, as well as a message to the end user if so requested.

The dashboard can use a combination of compliance rule sets and generic “watch lists” based on filters and groups.

##End user portal

The end user portal allows users quick and simple access to view the devices they have enrolled onto the MDM solution and perform basic tasks as follows;

* Lock device
* Reset PIN
* Wipe device
* Locate device

The availability of these options to all end users can help reduce requests for assistance that may arise from forgotten PINs or lost devices.	

#Conclusion

MDM is quickly becoming vital for the enterprise and paramount for adequate device management. Utilising all of the services and features outlined above, our ability, as an industry, to manage devices both locally and across the world is made significantly easier.
